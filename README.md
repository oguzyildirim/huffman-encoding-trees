In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression.

## Results

```
Example 1:
Encoded bits: [0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0]
Decoded symbols: [B C B A C]

Example 2:
Encoded bits: [1 0 0 1 0 1 0]
Decoded symbols: [Z X Z Y]
